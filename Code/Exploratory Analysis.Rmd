## Executive Summary

This is a high level investigation into the nature of discussion board and
forum use in the Blackboard LMS of ASU Online classes. We examined thread-level
data gathered from over 5600 course-shells in sessions A and B between the spring semester of 2016 through
the spring semester of 2018. Findings revealed that student activity forms the basis
of nearly all forum activity and that threads are often short-lived. Extended user
interaction was rare, especially for interactions between students and instructors.
Implementation strategy accounted for a majority of the results and further
analysis in a narrower setting is recommended.

## Motivation

Forums are a feature used by nearly all ASU Online courses. Usage varies among 
course subjects but in many cases it is the only conduit for group communication
amongst students and instructors. It is therefore important to understand the types
of interactions that are taking place and their relationship with observable
outcomes, so we can inform instructional designers and instructors on factors
that are positively associated with these outcomes. This preliminary research document 
was intended to explore the nature of forum use with the use of thread-level data extracted 
from Blackboard discussion forums. In particular, we sought to understand
who started and participated in discussions, how long they lasted, and
how deep the conversations were. We also aimed to uncover the types of interactions
that occurred in forum threads as well as instructor responsiveness to student
posts. 

## Data Source
Our data was gathered from 1.6 million forum threads and encompassed over 4.8 million
posts. It spanned over 5600 undergraduate Blackboard course-shells from Spring 2016 through Summer 2018. We used only
Session A or Session B courses offerred in the spring or fall terms,
and excluded courses that had irregular course
structures or grading schemes. Finally, we excluded posts of irregularly high length.
After navigating to the individual forum webpage, we found that these
types of posts were generally instructors disseminating huge amounts of information at
once, so we determined that these posts were not of interest to this study as they
did not represent an actual instance of instructor or student-led discussion.


## Thread Starters

In the overall sample, 97% of threads were made by students, indicating that they are
initiating almost all activity on discussion forums. The extreme disparity between
faculty and student thread initiation is highlighted in Figure 1. For each course
in the data we calculated the proportion of threads started by faculty and by students
and plotted their distribution, finding that even in the aggregate students are initiating
nearly all activity. 

After filtering out threads that have less than 5 total posts, this proportion evens out slightly - 11% 
percent of threads with 5 or more posts are initiated by instructors. An even
stricter exclusion revealed that threads with 10 or more posts were initiated by
instructors a majority of the time. This result was somewhat expected, as courses
often have entire forums dedicated to student-initiated threads. For instance, an
instructor might have created a forum where students post responses to an essay or 
discussion prompt found elsewhere in the course. In this situation, students would
be expected to begin their own discussion, having already been prompted by the instructor.
Alternatively, an instructor may decide to instead create a thread that houses
student responses. Based on these findings it appears that a large majority
of faculty took the former approach - creating a forum and allowing students to
initiate threads on their own.

Practically speaking this approach would put the onus on students to investigate
their peer's responses, which might hinder the amount of responses individual threads
receieve. Although the effort it takes to move from thread to thread is minimal,
the fact that indivdual responses are contained in different locations in a forum
could create hurdles for natural peer discussion.

## Thread Participants

Thread participation helped characterized forum use by allowing us to observe the
types and sizes of groups forming in the discussion boards. A forum with a high
number of average thread participants might have been dedicated to broad discussion or
designed for accessibility, whereas forums with low user participation might
have been intended for collecting student responses to a particular discussion
question or assignment. 

Our findings revealed that threads generally had very few users and were predominantly
composed of students. Roughly a third of all threads had just a single user and 
84% had at most 3 unique participants. Figure 2 points out the dramatic dropoff 
in user participation - only 4% of the data had 5 or more users. Furthermore, 88% of all threads had no
faculty participation. This translates to faculty posting in about 20 of 160 threads
that are created throughout the duration of an average 8-week course.

```

Interestingly, nearly half of all threads created by instructors did not have any
student participation and the other half had unusually high student participation.
Similar to the result in the previous section, we found that threads with a high
level of participation disproportionately belonged to faculty. A summary of this finding
can be found in Figure 3. One possible explanation for this could be that a 
fraction of the instructor threads were not used for discussion, but rather for broadcasting information
to many students at once, like a discussion prompt or forum guidelines.
These types of threads would presumably have a higher amount of views then other
single-participant threads, and in fact we did find mild evidence in favor of
this. There was a significant difference between student and instructor-led threads 
in the number of views they received, but the gap only favored instructor threads by about 8 views.
Conversely, the second finding is probably caused by instructors using threads
as a repository for student posts - a way to keep prompt responses in
one location. Like the previous example, we found evidence in favor of this possibility
in the form of higher thread views. In fact, in threads with more than three participants
instructor-led threads on average were viewed 4.5 times as often as student-led 
threads.

<!-- We also found that faculty activity in a thread had no meaningful relationship with the number -->
<!-- of students that posted. Threads with at least one faculty post did have  -->
<!-- a statistically significant higher number of students on average, but the difference -->
<!-- was negligble.  -->

These findings suggest that discussion forums in Blackboard are primarily used either
for communication between very small groups of students or collecting student work.
With that said, it is important to recognize that it can still be beneficial for students to
see what faculty and their peers are writing, even if they are not part of a thread.
"Lurkers", as they are commonly referred to, are users who do exactly this - 
they read the ongoing conversation without participating. Although they may
not be outwardly expressing themselves, exposure to the differing opinions
of their peers and instructors can force students to think more critically
about course content. Although we are unable to directly observe lurking, we can
see how many times a parent post has been viewed. So, if a thread has far more
views than it does posts, we could guess that some of this viewing is being 
done by lurkers. Of course, this could also mean that the people posting are returning
to the thread to check for responses, but the point is that having more views
than posts allows for the possibility of lurking. In the data we
observed this phenomenon pretty frequently. The ECDF plot in Figure 4 points out
how common this actually is - 45% of threads had 3 times as many views as they did users,
and 23% had 5 times as many. This result suggests that lurking might be
a relatively common feature of ASUO forums.

## Thread Length

It is clear that forums are not being used for discussion amongst large groups,
but this does not necessarily imply lackluster thread activity. Rather, it could simply
be that smaller groups were the most common use-case. The total number of posts in
a thread, which we define as its length, is another dimension on which we measured
activity. Of the 1.6 million threads in our data set, a third of them had only
one post and 78% of them had no more than three. Anything beyond 5 posts was
quite rare, occurring only 7% of the time. Briefly put, most threads in ASUO forums are very short.

<!-- how many courses had threads with more than 5 posts? -->
<!-- of the courses that had a thread with more than 5 posts, how often did it occur? -->

```{r thread length distro, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ecdf(data[, thread_length])(1)
ecdf(data[, thread_length])(3)
1 - ecdf(data[, thread_length])(5)

data %>%
  mutate(`Thread Length` = if_else(thread_length < 10, as.character(thread_length), "More than 10")) %>%
  group_by(`Thread Length`) %>%
  summarise(prop = (n() / nrow(data))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(`Thread Length`, prop)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(thread_length)) +
  stat_ecdf() +
  xlim(0, 20)

data[thread_length > 5, .SD[1], bb_course_id][
  , .(size = median(num_students))
]

data[thread_length > 5, .SD[1], bb_course_id][
  , .(count = .N), bb_course_id
]
```

Disaggregating length by thread owner revealed that instructor-led
threads did have more posts on average, but the difference was not all that large.
After trimming any extreme outliers, these threads had approximately 0.75 more posts per thread.
This effect is even less important when we take into account that the average
number of student posts did not change significantly depending on the thread owner.
Similarly, threads with at least one faculty response had no notable differece in 
the number of student posts compared to those with no faculty responses. These 
outcomes suggest that there does not appear to be any notable
relationship between faculty and student posting behavior at a very high level.


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# instr-started threads longer than student ones
tl1 <- data[thread_owner_role == "P" & thread_length <= 16, thread_length]
tl2 <- data[thread_owner_role == "S" & thread_length <= 16, thread_length]

t.test(tl1, tl2)

tl3 <- data[thread_owner_role == "P" & thread_length <= 16, num_stu_posts]
tl4 <- data[thread_owner_role == "S" & thread_length <= 16, num_stu_posts]

t.test(tl3, tl4)
```


```{r}
# thread length with one fac post
tl3 <- data[num_fac_posts > 0 & thread_length <= 16, thread_length]
tl4 <- data[num_fac_posts == 0 & thread_length <= 16, thread_length]

t.test(tl3, tl4)

# thread length with one fac post
tl5 <- data[faculty_responses > 0 & thread_length <= 16, num_stu_posts]
tl6 <- data[faculty_responses == 0 & thread_length <= 16, num_stu_posts]

t.test(tl5, tl6)
```

We devised an alternative metric whose purpose was to quantify the depth of the
conversation of the thread. In other words, we wanted another way to observe activity
by measuring the length of conversations in a thread. We called this metric a thread's "width",
and defined it as the maximum number of chain replies in a thread. As an example, 
imagine a thread with just one post - we would
define this thread to have a width of 0. When someone replies to that post, the
width increases to 1 and if someone responds to that reply the width will increase
again to 2, and so on. To contrast, if there exists a post with 10 replies but
they are all replying to the parent post, that thread will only have width 1,
as there are no chain replies that continue the conversation. The width of a thread
is constrained by its length, so it was not surprising to find that 86% of threads have
a width of either 0 or 1. The implication of this is that most threads are either
a lone post with no responses, or a post with responses but no additional chain responses. Longer
threads have marginally higher thread width on average but it is a very slight improvement.
Threads with five or more posts have an average width of 2 and threads with at least
ten posts hover around 3. This is an encouraging result for measuring user engagement,
but these threads represent a very small minority of the data.


<!-- who are the extremes? describe these scenarios -->

```{r thread_width distro}
ecdf(data[, thread_width])(1)

mean(data[thread_length >= 5, thread_width])
mean(data[thread_length >= 10, thread_width])


1 - ecdf(data[, thread_length])(4)
1 - ecdf(data[, thread_length])(9)

```



In the few threads that did have a significant number of posts, we expected
there to be lengthier or repeated user interactions. We were able to directly
measure this by observing the change in the number of posts per student and the thread width as
length increased. Generally speaking, both metrics measured the amount of interaction
an individual had with a given thread, but there is an important distinction between the two.
The number of posts per student specifically measured repeated
interaction with a thread no matter who or what the student is responding to. On the
other hand, the width represented the extent of interaction within a thread and did not take into account the type of users. 
Threads with a high number of posts per student and low width were indicative of
good individual presence but short-lived interaction. To contrast, a thread with
a low number of posts per student and high width would imply high levels of interaction
but limited presence. Ideally, longer threads would see increases in at least one
of these metrics, but it is not guaranteed. In the data, we observed an increase in both.
That is, the number of posts
per student and thread width both have a positive relationship with thread length.
However, it is not clear if the relationship is necessarily strong enough to have
a significant impact on the quality and quantity of user interaction. In threads
with less than 30 posts, the mean number of posts per student did not exceed 3. 
Thread width did increase faster with more posts - by the time a thread reached 10
posts it had on average a width of 3, indicating a moderate
amount of conversation between users in larger threads. This is a promising result
but it should be stressed that a very small minority of all threads even make it past
the third post.

## Characterizing responses

Social presence is an important determinant of student success. This is especially
true for online students, who are inherently detached from the classroom and must
interact with peers and faculty through digital means. The discussion forum
is meant to be one venue for this type of interaction, so it is vital to understand
the quantity and types of interactions taking place in order to evaluate the efficacy of this tool.

To begin, threads rarely had more than a couple student responses - 80% had less than three.
There was a statistically significant increase in the number of student responses
when the thread was created by a faculty member, so it appeared that students were
perhaps more responsive to faculty than their peers. After controlling for outliers,
this amounted to an increase of about 1 student response when faculty started the thread. In
addition, we observed a 48% increase in the average student response length
when the thread was created by a faculty member, indicating that
faculty-initated threads have at least some positive association with student posting
behavior. It is important to note that this data did not evaluate the actual content
of the student responses, so this relationship does not necessarily imply that faculty activity precipitated
higher-quality student posts. This statistic also conceals the fact that instructor-led
threads account for less than 3% of the data. In any case, this is a notable result
because it implies there is at least some meaningful difference in the way
students respond to faculty as opposed to other students.

```{r}
ecdf(data[, student_responses])(2)

r1 <- data[thread_owner_role == "P" & thread_length <= 20, student_responses]
r2 <- data[thread_owner_role == "S" & thread_length <= 20, student_responses]

t.test(r1, r2)

data %>%
  mutate(`Student Responses` = if_else(student_responses < 10, as.character(student_responses), "More than 10")) %>%
  group_by(`Student Responses`) %>%
  summarise(prop = (n() / nrow(data))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(`Student Responses`, prop)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')


r3 <- data[thread_owner_role == "P" & avg_stu_response_len <= 3753, avg_stu_response_len]
r4 <- data[thread_owner_role == "S" & avg_stu_response_len <= 3753, avg_stu_response_len]

t.test(r3, r4)

```

Instructors exhibited a similar pattern of responsiveness - 90% of threads had no
faculty responses. This alone is not problematic because expecting high 
faculty responsiveness in every thread is unreasonably burdensome. However, very few
threads had anything more than a single response. Of the 10% of threads with faculty responses,
82% had just one and 12% had two. So, even when there is some form of engagement 
faculty participation is still quite limited. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
ecdf(data[, faculty_responses])(0)

ecdf(data[faculty_responses > 0, faculty_responses])(1)
ecdf(data[faculty_responses > 0, faculty_responses])(2)
```

```{r}

data %>%
  filter(studs_in_thread > 2,
         studs_in_thread <= 10,
         faculty_responses > 0) %>%
  mutate(type = if_else(studs_in_thread < 5, "2-5 Students", "5-10 Students")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(prop_stu_responded_to, fill = type)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.2)

mean(data[between(studs_in_thread, 5, 10) & faculty_responses > 0, prop_stu_responded_to])
mean(data[between(studs_in_thread, 5, 30) & faculty_responses > 0, prop_stu_responded_to])

         studs_in_thread <= 50) %>%

## Discussion

Broadly speaking, these findings would seem to indicate that Blackboard forums
are not being used to generate a great amount of discussion amongst faculty and students.
At a high level, thread activity is student-led and very brief. This is evidenced
by the fact that a large majority of threads have no more than a handful of posts
and that conversations do not last very long. One encouraging finding was
the positive association between faculty-initiated threads and student posting 
behavior, but this result should be approached cautiously. Threads started
by faculty members seldom occurred, and furthermore that outcome could simply
be an artefact of teaching style - faculty may have specifically intended for 
students to reply within the faculty thread, instead of creating one on their own.
In addition, both student and faculty repsonsiveness in threads did not give 
strong evidence for the presence of healthy, collaborative discussion. Again,
this might be the result of the manner in which discussion forums are implemented.

With that said, it is necessary to make clear the fact that these findings are
very general and do not apply in every context. Most importantly, the data that
was used did not account for differences in forum use across course subject types
- something that will likely account for great variation in these results. There is
still much to be explored in this space and narrowing the focus of forum research
will be vital in creating a greater understanding of their use in ASUO courses. 
Future research should identify courses or subjects known to make significant
use of discussion forums so that more nuanced relationships between faculty
and student engagement can be uncovered.

## Statement of Actionability

A majority of courses offered in ASU Online programs make use of the discussion
forum feature in the Blackboard Learning Management System. In spite of this, our
understanding of their implementation in the course is generally unknown or poorly
understood, hindering us from quantifying student and faculty behaviors that are
related to student success. This paper attempts to alleviate that problem in the
following ways:

- Explicitly define and track measures of user engagement on discussion forums,
including the frequency and depth of interaction between users. These measures will
allow analysts, researchers, and designers to better understand the nature of 
discussion forum implementation across sections, courses, and subjects.

- Build an architecture for digestion and transformation of highly granular information
about forum posting activity. Future analyses built upon this architecture can be used
to assess the health of forums in a course or set of courses. This ability
can be utilized by Instructional Designers and Course Quality Managers to identify
courses that might be positively affected by changes in forum use policies.

- Provide high-level insight into the characteristics of forum use across
a broad sample of use-cases. These findings will allow future research
to uncover a robust understanding of the relationships between student
activity, faculty activity, and course outcomes, from which a more informed
theory of forum use can develop.

<!-- ### Working Notes: -->


<!-- find examples of really good thread usage (think about number of participants, -->
<!-- posts per student) -->

<!--   - this should start giving you an idea of the "types" of threads: -->
<!--     - discussion + reply -->
<!--     - group discussion -->
<!--     - instructor announcements -->
<!--     - Q/A sesh -->
<!--     - etc.  -->


<!-- - how many threads have one student post and one student reply? -->
<!-- - In really long threads are student replies any longer than short threads? -->
<!--   how does avg_stu_response_len change with the amount of participants -->
<!--     (small group v. large group) -->
<!--   does avg_stu_response_len change at all when there is at least one faculty post? -->
<!--     think - if a student knows a faculty is participating do they make longer posts -->
<!-- - is there a correlation b/w num of student responses and num of faculty posts -->

# Measuring-Faculty-Engagement-in-Online-Courses

Forums are a common component of online courses. Generally, they are
used a medium for students and instructors to interact with one another for
discussion, inquiry, etc.

Instructors generally use these forums to make announcements regarding due dates,
answer student questions and comment on student discussion. This project explores
how faculty engagement in these specific environments affects various student outcomes.
Specifically, we investigate its relationship with student activity and student grades.

This project had several other collaborators whose work may or may not be included
in this repository. The other collaborators who helped accomplish this project
were Phil Arcuria, Patrick Pettyjohn, and Mike Sharkey.


#### Notes

There are three documents in this repository detailing our findings -

1. Exploratory_Analysis.pdf
    * EDA of the discussion forum data; discusses missing data, basic distributions,
    and drops we made in order to move on to modeling

2. Modeling_Workspace.pdf
    * Any modeling done by myself is cataloged here; this does not contain all of
    the information contained in the final paper.

3. Paper_Final.pdf
    * A complete write-up of our findings; includes work not necessarily contained
    in this repo

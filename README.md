# Measuring-Faculty-Engagement-in-Online-Courses

Forums are a common component of online courses. Generally, they are
used a medium for students and instructors to interact with one another for
discussion, inquiry, etc.

Instructors generally use these forums to make announcements regarding due dates,
answer student questions and comment on student discussion. This project explores
how faculty engagement in these specific environments affects various student outcomes.
Specifically, we investigate its relationship with student activity and student grades.
